Scott Morrison signs off on development of new financing model to encourage housing investment

The nation's treasurers have agreed to develop a new way to encourage investment in affordable rental and community housing, but the Commonwealth is still resisting calls to change tax concessions.

Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison signed off on the development of a new financing model at a meeting with his state and territory counterparts in Canberra.

It will be designed to group together financing requests to generate more investment at cheaper interest rates.

"One of the challenges that is faced by those developing affordable housing is access to longer-term, affordable finance," Mr Morrison said.

"The access to capital is a critical issue for that sector and this would involve the states and Commonwealth working together to act as a bond aggregator to put finance into those developments."

Mr Morrison's focus on rental affordability has been welcomed by the peak body, Homelessness Australia.

"The sorts of devices being discussed to stimulate housing investment at the low end of the market are all the sorts of things we need," Homelessness Australia chairman Jenny Smith said.

"But they're not a magic pudding — they are going to need government support and government investment to work."

The model was recommended by an affordable housing working group, which has also called on Governments to consider other ways to improve affordability and supply, including changes to zoning and planning rules, and taxation and other concessions.

Despite calls from some states to consider winding back negative gearing, Mr Morrison said the Federal Government would not revisit it.
